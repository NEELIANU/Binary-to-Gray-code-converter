# Binary-to-Gray-code-converter
ðŸ”¹ Overview

A Binary to Gray Code Converter is a digital circuit that converts binary numbers into their equivalent Gray code representation.
Gray code is a special binary numbering system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

ðŸ”¹ Why Gray Code?

Minimizes errors during transitions in digital circuits, especially in counters and encoders.

Prevents glitches in hardware systems where multiple bits change simultaneously in binary numbers.

Commonly used in:

Rotary encoders

Error correction systems

Communication protocols

Digital counters

ðŸ”¹ Features

Converts any binary input into its Gray code equivalent.

Parameterized design to support different bit-widths.

Simple and efficient logic implementation.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

The Most Significant Bit (MSB) of Gray code is the same as the MSB of the binary number.

Each subsequent Gray code bit is generated by performing an XOR between consecutive binary bits.

Example: Gray[i] = Binary[i+1] XOR Binary[i]

ðŸ”¹ Usage

Integrate into counters for glitch-free output.

Use in communication systems to reduce transition errors.

Apply in digital design projects requiring stable sequential data representation.
